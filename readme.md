# seferize_base

**seferize_base** is the original core of the first version of [seferize](https://github.com/YourUser/seferize).
It contains the fundamental structures and logic upon which the modern `seferize` was later rebuilt.

This project serves as a **compatibility foundation** and **historical reference** for developers who wish to understand or reuse the early architecture before the modular redesign.
