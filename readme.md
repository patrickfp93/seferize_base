# 📜 SEFERIZE

> *"Revealing the written form of your Rust code."* ✨

A **procedural macro** that converts any Rust item (`struct`, `enum`, `trait`, `impl`, etc.) into its **string representation** at compile time.

It can **automatically generate** a `&'static str` constant with the textual content of the item — useful for **reflection**, **documentation generation**, **code introspection**, or **debugging macro systems**.

---

## 🧩 Features

* ✅ Converts entire Rust items (structs, traits, impls, enums, etc.) into strings.
* ✅ Removes self-invoking macros from within the processed item.
* ✅ Supports the attribute `#[ignore]` to **exclude specific items or blocks** from being stringified.
* 🧱 Optionally accepts a custom name for the generated string constant.
* ⚡ Works at **compile time** — no runtime cost.
* 💡 Easy integration with tools that require code serialization, logging, or reflection.
* 🕊️ 100% safe and pure Rust.

## 🧠 How it works

When you annotate an item with `#[seferize]`, it generates a `&'static str` constant containing the **exact Rust source** of that item.
By default, the generated constant name follows the pattern `CODE_<ITEM_NAME>` unless another name is provided.

### Example

```rust
use seferize::seferize;

#[seferize]
pub struct User {
    id: u32,
    name: String,
}
```

Generates:

```rust
pub const CODE_USER: &str = "pub struct User { id: u32, name: String }";
```

## 🚫 Ignoring code with `#[ignore]`

You can mark any **item, block, or function** with `#[ignore]` to prevent it from being included in the generated string.

This is useful when you want to **skip internal helpers**, **test functions**, or **macros** that shouldn’t appear in the final output of `seferize`.

### Example — ignoring items

```rust
use seferize::seferize;

#[seferize]
mod my_module {
    pub struct Visible {
        field: i32,
    }

    #[ignore]
    pub fn hidden_fn() {
        println!("This function won't appear in CODE_MY_MODULE");
    }
}
```

Result:

```rust
pub const CODE_MY_MODULE: &str = r#"
mod my_module {
    pub struct Visible {
        field: i32,
    }
}
"#;
```

### Example — ignoring macros

```rust
use seferize::seferize;

#[seferize]
fn example() {
    #[ignore]
    println!("Ignored!");

    println!("This line will appear in the stringified output");
}
```

Result:

```rust
pub const CODE_EXAMPLE: &str = r#"
fn example() {
    println!("This line will appear in the stringified output");
}
"#;
```

## ⚙️ Advanced usage

### Custom constant name

You can override the generated name by passing a custom identifier:

```rust
use seferize::seferize;

#[seferize("CUSTOM_NAME")]
pub enum Event {
    Created,
    Updated,
}
```

This produces:

```rust
pub const CUSTOM_NAME: &str = "pub enum Event { Created, Updated }";
```

---

## 🪶 Internal behavior

* Macros like `seferize::stringify`, `stringify`, `seferize::ignore`, and `ignore` are automatically removed from the item before string generation.
* Works recursively: if a module, impl block, or nested structure contains ignored items, they’re filtered out as well.
* Uses the Rust `syn` and `quote` crates for reliable parsing and code regeneration.

## 🙌 Inspiration

The name **Seferize** comes from the Hebrew word *“Sefer”* (ספר), meaning *“book”* or *“scroll”*, symbolizing the act of **revealing written words**.

> *“The entrance of Thy words giveth light.”* — **Psalm 119:130**
